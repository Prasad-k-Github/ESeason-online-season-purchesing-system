## Introduction

Sri Lanka Railways currently operates a manual seasoning system, causing delays and increasing the workload on railway staff. **E-Season** addresses these challenges by introducing a mobile application for passengers and a web-based application for railway staff, streamlining the seasoning process, enhancing user experience, and improving operational efficiency.

## Problem Statement

The existing manual ticketing system for train season passes leads to long queues, passenger dissatisfaction, and high operational demands on railway staff. **E-Season** aims to provide a comprehensive digital solution to these issues by offering both mobile and web-based applications that enable passengers to purchase tickets online and railway staff to manage ticketing and passenger data efficiently.

## Objectives

1. **Improve Convenience**: Allow passengers to buy season tickets digitally, reducing the need to queue at counters.
2. **Enhance Efficiency**: Provide railway staff with a web application to manage seasons, validate purchases, and monitor real-time passenger data.
3. **Automate Operations**: Simplify seasoning processes and reduce manual intervention, decreasing human errors.
4. **Enhance User Experience**: Offer intuitive and accessible user interfaces for passengers and staff.

## Architecture

### System Architecture

E-Season utilizes a distributed architecture with separate components for mobile and web applications:

- **Backend**: A unified backend, built with Spring Boot and Node.js, handles authentication, ticket management, and real-time data.
- **Frontend - Mobile App**: Developed with React Native, it provides an interactive experience for passengers on both iOS and Android.
- **Frontend - Web App**: Developed using React or Angular, offering a robust interface for railway staff to manage ticketing and passenger interactions.

### Database Structure

The backend uses a SQL database, storing essential data in multiple tables:

- **Users**: Stores profiles, roles, and authentication data for passengers and railway staff.
- **Tickets**: Contains ticket availability, purchase history, and associated route data.
- **Transactions**: Logs all ticket purchase transactions, including payment details.

## Technologies Used

- **Mobile Frontend**: React Native, Redux, Expo
- **Web Frontend**: React or Angular for the web application
- **Backend**: Spring Boot (Java) and Node.js (JavaScript) for microservices
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (or preferred SQL database)
- **Payment Integration**: Stripe or PayPal for secure transactions
- **Notifications**: Firebase Cloud Messaging for mobile push notifications
- **Security**: Multi-factor authentication (MFA), encryption for data privacy

## User Stories

1. **As a daily commuter**, I want to purchase a season ticket online so I donâ€™t have to wait in line.
2. **As a student**, I want quick access to discounted tickets so I can manage my expenses.
3. **As a senior citizen**, I want an easy-to-use app interface with larger text and accessible navigation.
4. **As railway staff**, I want a web platform to validate tickets and view passenger information for efficient management.
